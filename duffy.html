<h1> A Tale of Two Cities: Chinatown's Park Row </h1>
	<p> Twenty-three years later, New York City’s last “frozen zone” continues to hamper accessibility and business access to the historic Chinatown while continuing to beautify the area with street art and pedestrian friendly infrastructure. 

The Park Row “frozen zone” in the Lower East Side is a six-lane intersection; St. James Pl. , Oliver St. , East Broadway, Bowery St. , Mott St. , and Worth St.  all intersecting near Kimlau Square in the Lower East Side. The roadway running south has been cut off to public vehicle access since the September 11 attacks. 

The changes have impacted the area differently with some people supporting the closure beautifying the area and reducing vehicular emissions south of the Brooklyn Bridge while those north of the Brooklyn Bridge believe they’re losing out on crucial business access.

Below, data collected from a 2020 Census tract found residents along Park Row differ significantly in income brackets. Just north of the Brooklyn Bridge the community is predominantly Asian and earns significantly less than those south of the Brooklyn Bridge in the Financial District where most of the beautification and bike lanes are located.
